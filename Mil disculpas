Hola Camilo, intenté hacer mil veces el programa final, pero no pude lograrlo, ya veo que si me toca ver como integró Apps, con la IA, me ha sido complejo, ni viendo tutoriales pude lograrlo.
Trabajé solo, porque en estos meses la carga laboral se aumenta bastante, te agradezco el tiempo, dedicación y entusiasmo por realizar la labor.
También aprovecho que iba en proceso del vídeo, pero le dedique tantas horas, que al final me ganó la procastinación y quedó así, voy a necesitar de un influencer para que lo desarrolle, aunque esto será muy costoso.

Saludos, y muchas gracias.

💻 The Perfect Nutrition Algorithm: Project Summary
The future Will be  "The Perfect Nutrition Algorithm" is a robust API (built with Python/FastAPI) designed to replace the slow, manual process of diet planning with fast, precise, and scientifically backed mathematical optimization.
1. 🎯 The Problem
Traditional diets are generic, and personalized meal plans created manually are fragile, time-consuming, and hard to scale. The mission is to bring engineering precision to nutrition, moving from intuition to mathematical optimization to maximize health, energy, and longevity while addressing modern real-world constraints.
2. ⚙️ The Technical Solution: A Three-Stage Flow
The system operates through three essential stages:
•	Data Science: Clustering: Raw food datasets are rigorously cleaned, and the K-Means Machine Learning algorithm is used to segment thousands of foods into validated nutritional profiles (e.g., Cluster 0: Light, Cluster 1: Energy, Cluster 2: Protein). This ensures the model works only with foods that have a clear nutritional signature.
•	Optimization Engine (The Core): This uses Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), powered by PuLP.
o	Objective: Minimize the total grams of food required.
o	Constraints: Simultaneously satisfy all user requirements, including exact caloric targets (e.g., 2500 Kcal), precise macro/micronutrient limits (e.g., 20% protein, 30% carbs), and crucial real-world restrictions like maximum calories per single food item (e.g., $\le 350$ Kcal) and a minimum serving size (e.g., $\ge 30$ grams) to ensure diet variety and realism.
•	Result Generation: The API instantly calculates the user's need and delivers a mathematically perfect meal plan (with 10, 15, or 20 diverse foods) that meets all defined nutritional and consumption constraints.
3. 🚀 Business Value Proposition
The project's value is speed and precision—offering algorithmic confidence instead of just a generic diet.
•	Scalability: Generates a custom, scientifically backed meal plan "faster than a click," eliminating the bottleneck in personalized nutrition consulting.
•	Precision: Delivers a guaranteed optimal plan that meets all defined constraints, unlike fragile spreadsheet-based methods.
•	Integration: The motor is scalable and ready to integrate into existing health apps, fitness platforms, and nutrition clinics.
